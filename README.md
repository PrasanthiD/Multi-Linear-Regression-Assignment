# Multi-Linear-Regression-Assignment
Prepare a prediction model for profit of 50_startups data. Do transformations for getting better predictions of profit and make a table containing R^2 value for each prepared model.  

R&amp;D Spend -- Research and devolop spend in the past few years 

Administration -- spend on administration in the past few years 

Marketing Spend -- spend on Marketing in the past few years 

State -- states from which data is collected 

Profit  -- profit of each state in the past few years
